# openwrt-google-authenticator

Makefile for compiling the libpam version of Google Authenticator for OpenWrt 18.06.2.

You will need to know how to use the OpenWrt SDK for your target.

And if you want to use Google Authenticator with SSH, you will need to compile the openssh-server-pam package and install this with the re-compiled dependencies.
